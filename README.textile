h1. Menutron 

A jQuery plugin for responsive navigation menus

h2. What it does

Menutron transforms your navigation menus from a list to a select menu when resizing your browser. On mobile devices, the select menu pulls up a native control, making it easier to pick an item.

* *It's concise* - When implemented in a responsive design, your menu becomes consolidated in to a single control, saving you horizontal and/or vertical real-estate.
* *It's intuitive* - It works on any type of list (ol,ul,dl) and the select control is easily recognizable.
* *It's convenient* - On mobile devices, the select controls will activate a native control, like the picker control for iOS, which can be navigated using drag, nudge, or flick gestures. 


h2. How it does it

Let's say your navigation menu markup looks like this:

<pre>
<nav id="main">
  <ul>
    <li><a href='google.com'>Google</a></li>
    <li><a href='facebook.com'>Facebook</a></li>
    <li><a href='twitter.com'>Twitter</a></li>
    <li><a href='pinterest.com'>Pinterest</a></li>
    <li><a href='flickr.com'>Flickr</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
</pre>

Simply call the Menutron function, using the navigation tag as a selector

<pre>
<script>
  $(function(){
    $("nav#main").menutron();
  });
</script>
</pre>

By default, the plugin has a media query set to @max-width: 600px@. If you want to set your own media query, the plugin has an option for that. Just pass in your desired size to @maxScreenWidth@ like below:

<pre>
<script>
  $(function(){
    $("nav#main").menutron({
      maxScreenWidth: 480
    });
  });
</script>
</pre>

Now any device below a width of @480px@ will get a select menu.  

h2. What you'll need (dependencies)

* *"A responsive design":http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/* ;)
* *"The latest jQuery":http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js* (It may work on previous versions, but it's only been tested on the latest)
* For devices with retina displays, a @<meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=1.0" />@ in the head will make the device screen resolution equal to the device screen size (1:1). Although not needed, I also disable zooming when controls are selected. Below is my meta tag:

<pre>
<meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no" />
</pre>
